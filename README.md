# Secured
## Goal of the project  
code a library of hashtable and linked list function  
to secure large amount of data in an encrypted hashtable  
## Functions  
- **`ht_delete_table`** : delete the given hashtable
- **`ht_delete`** : delete the given data in the hashtable
- **`ht_dump`** : Display the hashtable's content 
- **`ht_hash`** : Hashing function (gives a random number between 0 and the max given to secure the data)
- **`ht_insert`** : Insert an element in the hashtable by hashing it's key
- **`ht_new`** : Create a new hashtable and give it a pointer to a hash function
- **`ht_search`** : Search data using it's key in a hashtable
## Usage
use **`make`** to create the **`libhashtable.a`** lib  
you can use it by compiling the lib with your program
